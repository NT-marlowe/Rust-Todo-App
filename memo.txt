error: failed to select a version for `libsqlite3-sys`.
    ... required by package `rusqlite v0.25.0`
    ... which is depended on by `r2d2_sqlite v0.18.0`
    ... which is depended on by `todo v0.1.0 (/home/marlowe/work_evid/todo)`
versions that meet the requirements `^0.22.0` are: 0.22.2, 0.22.1, 0.22.0

the package `libsqlite3-sys` links to the native library `sqlite3`, but it conflicts with a previous package which links to `sqlite3` as well:
package `libsqlite3-sys v0.18.0`
    ... which is depended on by `rusqlite v0.23.0`
    ... which is depended on by `todo v0.1.0 (/home/marlowe/work_evid/todo)`

failed to select a version for `libsqlite3-sys` which could resolve this conflict


rusqlite = { version = "0.25", features=["bundled"] }
ここを0.23から0.25にしたらエラー消えたよ
